# Todo_list_without_DB

# Overview
"My To-Do List Application" is a simple and visually appealing task management app. Users can:

1. Add tasks.
2. Mark tasks as completed or unmark them.
3. Edit tasks.
4. Delete tasks. The app uses localStorage to persist tasks, ensuring data remains available even after refreshing the page. The UI is responsive and includes a modal for task editing.

3. **Mark/Unmark Tasks**
